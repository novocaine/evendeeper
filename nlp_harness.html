		<p>The Palestinians pulled out of a new round of indirect peace talks last night, even before they had begun, as a protest at <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/israel" title="More from
guardian.co.uk on Israel">Israel</a>'s decision to announce approval for hundreds of new homes in a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.</p><p>The decision to pull out, announced in Cairo by Amr
Moussa, head of the Arab League, represents a major setback to months of diplomacy by the US administration and comes after the US vice-president, <a
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/joebiden" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Joe Biden">Joe Biden</a>, delivered an unusually strong rebuke to Israel.</p><p>Amr Moussa said he had been told
by the Palestinian president, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mahmoud-abbas" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Mahmoud Abbas">Mahmoud Abbas</a>, that even this low-key process of
so-called "proximity talks" could not start unless Israel stopped expanding its settlements.</p><p>"The Palestinian side is not ready to negotiate under the present circumstances," Moussa
said.</p><p>Israeli and Palestinian leaders have not held direct negotiations since Israel's war in Gaza last year. The White House had won agreement on Monday from the two sides to begin the
indirect talks, hoping they would lead to face-to-face meetings.</p><p>The Palestinians had insisted there would be no direct talks unless Israel halted all settlement expansion, in line with the
demands of the US administration and the roadmap, which remains the framework of peace talks.</p><p>But Israel's prime minister, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/binyamin-netanyahu"
title="More from guardian.co.uk on Binyamin Netanyahu">Binyamin Netanyahu</a>, leading a rightwing coalition government, offered only a temporary, partial curb to new building.</p><p>Then, on
Tuesday, hours after Biden met Israeli leaders, the Israeli interior ministry announced approval for 1,600 new apartments in Ramat Shlomo, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
All settlements on occupied land are illegal under international law.</p><p>Israel's opposition Kadima party said it is planning a no-confidence vote in the prime minister in parliament for
"destroying" the Biden visit.</p><p>Yesterday, Biden emerged from talks with Abbas in Ramallah, on the occupied West Bank, and repeated his criticisms of the timing and substance of Israel's
announcement. "It is incumbent on both parties to build an atmosphere of support for negotiations and not to complicate them," he said.</p><p>"The decision by the Israeli government to advance
planning for new housing units in East Jerusalem undermines that very trust, the trust that we need right now in order to begin â€¦ profitable negotiations."</p><p>Palestinian prime minister Salam
Fayyad said the Palestinians appreciated "the strong statement of condemnation" by the US administration.</p><p>Eli Yishai, Israel's interior minister, apologised for the timing of the
announcement, admitting that it had caused Biden "real embarrassment".</p>
